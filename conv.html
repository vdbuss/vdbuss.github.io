<title>Conversations at scientific meetings</title>

When, during the coffee break at a scientific meeting,
you ask someone a question about their work, and you are very
lucky, you might get a direct answer.  If not, the following
translations may be helpful:

<ul>
<li>
I already thought about that question, but I forget the answer.
<p>
<i>Meaning: I am more famous than you.</i>
<li>
That's a very interesting question, let me think about it.
<p>
<i>Meaning: You are more famous than me.</i>
<li>
That's a very interesting question, let's write a joint paper about it.
<p>
<i>Meaning: We are equally famous, but I am lazier.</i>
</ul>
