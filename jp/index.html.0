  <h2>Dinner on thursday</h2>
  The evening prior to the symposium, so evening of Thursday 20
  September 2007, we meet with all speakers and other invitees,
  together with Jan
  Paredaens, for dinner in downtown Antwerp.  Details follow
  later! 
<a name="walk">
  <h2>Guided walk on thursday</h2>
  During the day on Thursday 20 September 2007, we are also
  organising a guided walk through Antwerp, for the people
  coming from abroad.  Again, details follow later!
<a name="program">
  <h2>Location</h2>
  The symposium will take place in Antwerpen, Belgium,
  at the University of Antwerp,
  campus Middelheim, building G "Wiskunde-Informatica".
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Belgium</strong> is easily reached by air, through the
    international <a
      href="http://www.brusselsairport.be">Brussels Airport</a>
    (not to be confused with "Brussels South" airport, which is
    actually in <a
      href="http://www.charleroi-airport.com">Charleroi</a>).
    <li><strong>Antwerpen</strong> is easily reached by car or by
    train, with two major train stations:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Antwerpen-Central</strong> in city center of Antwerp.
      <li><strong>Antwerpen-Berchem</strong> is closer to the
      campus Middelheim of the university.
    </ul>
    From Brussels airport, every 15 minutes, you can take a train to Brussels
    North station. From there, you can take a train to
    Antwerp (both Central and Berchem; the train stops first in Berchem).
    The train connection from Brussels North to Antwerpen is very
    fast and frequent.
    <em>You can buy a ticket straight until
      Antwerp already at the airport.</em>
    <li><strong>Antwerp University, campus Middelheim,</strong>
    street address: Middelheimlaan 1, 2020 Antwerpen,
    is easily reached:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>from the city center by bus</strong>, line 32,
      you can take this bus in the Quellinstraat, this is the second street
      left off the
      De Keyserlei which is the main boulevard coming out of the
      central station.
      At peak hours there is a bus every 10 minutes.  Get off at the stop
      "Koninklijkelaan", this is right in front of the campus.
      You can ask the bus driver to warn you when to get off (ask
      for campus Middelheim of the university).  The trip takes
      20 to 23 minutes.
      <li><strong>from the city center by tram</strong>, line 15
      direction "Mortsel":
      this is a good alternative if you don't mind walking 500 meters.
In the city center you can take this tram (it runs frequently) in any of the
underground metro stations.  After just 12 minutes ride,
      get off at the stop "Koninklijkelaan" (by then
      the tram is no longer underground).  Although it has the
      same name, this is not the same
      stop as the bus stop mentioned above!  Now walk along the
      Koninklijkelaan ("Royal Lane") to the campus.
      <li> <strong>from station Antwerpen-Berchem</strong>, by
      bus line 32 (the same one as above, indeed it passes
      through Berchem).
    </ul>
  </ul>

<a name="accommodation">
  <h2>Accommodation</h2>
  The city center of Antwerp boasts a large number of good
  hotels.  For convenience of transportation, take a hotel close
  to the central station.  Some hotels very close to the central
  station are the Tourist**, the Florida***, the Empire***, the
  Agora***, and the Atlanta***.  You can find all of them on <a
    href="http://hotels.com">hotels.com</a>.
  <p>
  One good hotel we can personally recommend for its friendly
  staff, it is 500 meters from the central station, is
  <a href="http://www.colombushotel.com">Hotel Colombus</a>.
  They give a special price for university
  guests; at check-in or check-out, just tell them you are
  visiting the university and they will give you a hefty discount.
  <p>
  Another hotel we can specially recommend, although it is not
  close to the central station, is <a
    href="http://www.elzenveld.be">Hotel Elzenveld</a>, for its
  wonderful building, atmosphere and location in the city center.
  They also give a special price for university guests.
  Moreover, you can easily take tram&nbsp;7 in front of this
  hotel and get off at the same stop "Koninklijkelaan" as that of
  tram&nbsp;15 mentioned above.
  <p>
  For the young or budget-conscious traveler, there is also a great
<a href="http://www.vjh.be">youth hostel in
  Antwerp</a> belonging to the Hosteling International quality
chain of hostels.
