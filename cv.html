<h3> Brief cv </h3>

In 1989 I graduated from the <a href="http://www.uia.ua.ac.be">
University of Antwerp (UIA)</a> with a diploma in
Mathematics - Computer Science.  I started to work on a PhD in Computer
Science at the same university, under <a
href="http://win-www.uia.ac.be/u/pareda"> Jan Paredaens</a>,
with a four-year scholarship from the <a href="http://www.nfwo.be">
Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research</a>.
In 1993 I obtained the PhD degree with "highest distinction and special
felicitations by the jury". My thesis was awarded with the IBM-Belgium
prize for PhD dissertations in computer science.
I spent the academic year 1994-95 at <a
href="http://www.inria.fr/welcome-eng.html">
INRIA Rocquencourt</a> in the <a
href="http://www-rocq.inria.fr/verso/"> Verso group</a> of Serge Abiteboul,
with a post-doc fellowship from the European Commission.
Back in Belgium I returned to UIA on a post-doctoral research position from
the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research.  In September
1996 I became a faculty member here at LUC.
I spent the summer of 1999 at <a href="http://www.cs.ucsd.edu">UCSD</a>.
