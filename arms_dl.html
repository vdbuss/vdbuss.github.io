<h1>Bill Arms on Digital Libraries</h1>

This interview appeared in the September 1997 issue of <em>ACMemberNet</em>.
I found it so interesting that I decided to distribute it to other
interested people via this web page.

<em>
Bill Arms, member of the ACM Publications Board since 1993, is one of the
world's experts on the current state of research in digital libraries. After
receiving degrees in mathematics and operational research from Oxford, the
London School of Economics, and Sussex University, Arms eventually specialized
in the academic uses of computing. He worked at Dartmouth and Carnegie Mellon
in the 70s and 80s and was involved with the first computer courses for the
British Open University.

<p>

<em>
In 1995 Arms joined the Corporations for National Research Initiatives (CNRI)
where he is involved in a number of electronic publishing and digital library
projects focusing on research and novel applications. One large program is in
conjunction with work funded by DARPA and NSF on
<a href="http://dli.grainger.uiuc.edu/national.htm">digital libraries</a>,
where Arms
provides supports to the program officers and is publisher of </em>D-Lib
Magazine<em>. His work also includes projects with the Library of Congress and
the U.S. Copyright Office, implementation projects with the U.S. Information
Agency and Defense Technical Information Center, and collaboration with
various universities on the networked Computer Science Technical Reports
Library.

<p>

<strong>Q:</strong> <em>The <a href="http://www.acm.org/pubs/">ACM Digital
Library</a> opened for world access this
past July 1st. How did this project evolve?</em>

<p>

<strong>A:</strong> ACM is the leading publisher of journals, conference
proceedings, and related items in the field of computing science. The first
generation of the ACM project has been to take what was traditionally
paper-based and publish electronically. It essentially has replicated the
intellectual processes and procedures that go into each stage of publishing by
using computers, networks, and computer storage. Much of what was formerly
only available on paper is now accessible electronically. One of the very good
things ACM has done is to convert older materials so that there are backruns
and the library doesn't just start with new materials from today.

<p>

<strong>Q:</strong> <em>What new challenges are in store now that the basic
project is up and running?</em>

<p>

<strong>A:</strong> As soon as you produce a project like this, you rapidly
start discovering that electronic publishing is not the same as paper
publishing. There are a lot more opportunities using computers and networks
that you don't have with paper, and conversely, there are a number of things
that make sense
with paper that don't in electronic publishing. When you get to
this point in an electronic publishing project, things get exciting.

<p>

For instance, the physical constraints of paper like fixed number of pages and
grouping papers into issues disappear when you publish electronically. You
start asking questions like "What is an article?" Instead of being restricted
by page counts because of the cost of printing and distributing, now you can
have open-ended articles with supporting material, additional data, and links
to other materials. Another question is whether you should distribute an
article as soon as it is ready or do you wait to make an issue?

<p>

What should a member subscribe to?  Creating materials and putting them up on
the network dominate the entire cost of electronic publishing so the marketing
and business plans have to change. ACM is, I think rightly, pushing for a
model that encourages <em>all</em> members to subscribe to everything. Taking
only one or two journals or proceedings no longer makes sense. With electronic
publishing we have a great database of computing science research and reports
that could be available as a whole to all members.

<p>

We also have to understand electronic publishing in the context of a world
where many, many things are changing. For example, in computing science
almost all research now goes up on the www before it gets published in
journals. So now we are facing the question of why, if a report is already on
the web, should anyone want to pay for a journal article with the same
material that comes out months later?

<p>

<strong>Q:</strong> <em>What changes are publishers facing with business
models for scientific publishing?</em>

<p>

<strong>A:</strong> The business model in the past has been fundamentally
journal-based where the costs of supporting professional staff have been
covered by subscriptions, which in most cases have been library subscriptions.
ACM has a substantial private membership but most scientific journals are paid
for by libraries. Library budgets come from general university funds, but when
you track it down, you see that a great deal of those funds come from indirect
cost recovery on research grants. This model of paying for scientific
publications has served very well for many, many years.

<p>

But now the model is in trouble in a variety of ways. One is that as the
number of journals has gone up, the number of subscribers to each journal has
gone down, and the unit costs have gone up. This is a bad cycle. Another
problem is that, with the tremendous emphasis on interdisciplinary research,
large numbers of people are working in fields where they were not working 3 or
5 years ago. Narrow, specialized publications are not what people need. They
want publications that bring things together from different disciplines, which
demands a higher standard of writing. And that means more professional writers
and editors.

<p>

The impact of the www and open communication has changed our expectations.
Even though I've personally spent my career in universities with very good
libraries right next door, now I'm working very effectively for an
organization that does not have a library. My only library is the www and
almost everything I want is available openly. Open distribution sets up
competition to the traditional publishers like ACM and is fundamentally
important in thinking through new business models.

<p>

<strong>Q:</strong> <em>How do you see these difficulties being resolved?</em>

<p>

<strong>A:</strong> Personally - and this is my personal opinion, not the
policy of the ACM Publications Board - I believe the long-term model must
support open access to scientific information. The fantastic thing about the
www is how much very high quality material is available. People want you to
read their material and are doing their utmost to remove barriers to access.
The challenge is how to combine that ideal with a cash flow that will support
the professional staff needed to have good scientific communication. 

<p>

I don't know how we are going to get from here to there, but I expect to see a
movement away from the "library pays" model. I think we will move towards
"producer pays," where universities, corporations, and publishers will put
money into their publications programs, as many are already doing. I think
we'll increasingly find all these groups competing for professionalism of
their scientific publications, including learning how to make them more
interdisciplinary. Since much of the money for library subscriptions now comes
from indirect cost recovery from research grants, there's
no fundamental reason
why, instead of that money going to libraries, it couldn't go directly to the
"producers," including the publishers.

<p>

<strong>Q:</strong> <em>Could you comment about these challenges in the larger
context of public policy? The need to charge individuals for content and
services is in conflict with the Internet ethos of "Information wants to be
free." Should there be free access via public libraries or paid-for access
through digital libraries?</em>

<p>

<strong>A:</strong> I have two comments. First of all, most research in the
U.S. is paid for by the taxpayer so I think he or she should ask the question,
"Why is access to the material not open to all?" My other comment is that
publishers compete no only for readers. They also compete for authors. Many of
the best authors in the computing science community tend to be very outspoken
about wanting to have open access to their materials. I believe that, in order
to compete for these authors, publishers are going to <em>have</em> to find
ways to make materials available through open access.

<p>

I personally believe that the world is going to change in the next 5 to 10
years more than anything we've ever seen up to now. Answers to some of these
questions may emerge in ways that we can't even imagine.
