    Advanced Database Technology: Erasmus Track
  </h1>
  This track will consist of three major parts:
  <ol>
    <li>
XML Schema and XQuery.
    <li>
    Develop an XQuery-based application.  This is a project
    assignment that can be done in group.
    <li>
    Spatial databases and GIS.
  </ol>
  <h2>
    XML Schema and XQuery
  </h2>
  This material can be learned from the W3C documentation on <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">XML Schema</a> and <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query/">XQuery</a>.
  We also recommend the book by Garcia-Molina, Ullman, and Widom:
  <em>Database Systems, The Complete Book</em> which is available
  in the <a href="http://www.uhasselt.be/UHasselt-Library">UHasselt
    library</a> and which has part 3 devoted to this material.
  There will be an individual, closed-book, written exam with
  theory questions on XML Schema and XQuery.  The questions will
  be of the kind as asked in the exercises of the above-mentioned
  book.

  <h2>
    Project
  </h2>
  The students develop, in group, an entire application in
  XQuery.  Usually XQuery is presented as just an XML query
  language, but in fact it has the ambition to serve as a
  fully-fledged development language.  The students are invited
  to test this hypothesis by trying to develop a full application
  in XQuery.  They can choose the specification of the
  application, but must let it approve by the professor.

  Here is some starting material on using XQuery as a development
  environment:
  <ul>
    <li>Paper <a
      href="http://alpha.uhasselt.be/jan.vandenbussche/erasmus/kkpaper.pdf"><em>Developing
	an Enterprise Web Application in XQuery</em></a>
    <li>Company website <a
      href="http://www.28msec.com">28msec</a>
    <li>XQuery processor <a
      href="http://www.zorba-xquery.com/site2/html/">Zorba</a>
  </ul>
  The students will defend their project for the professor
  on an appointed date.  The defense consists of a presentation
  of around 20 minutes on the goals and the methods, followed by
  a demonstration.  <strong>The students should also write a
    report on their project, of around 15 pages,</strong> where they
    describe their experiences with the project: what have you
    learned?  what were your goals?  what where the difficulties?
    how did you solve some of them?  The report should also
    clearly state how the work was divided among the students.
  <h2>
    Spatial Data and GIS
  </h2>
  This is part of the Dutch-language version of the course that
  has material in English and that the Erasmus students will
  follow together with the Belgian students.
  <strong>Make sure to come to the lecture on 14 December
    2011!</strong>
  The exam will have
  questions on this material.  There is also an
  <strong>assignment</strong> that
  has to be done with DB2 Spatial Extender.  See the <a
    href="https://bb.uhasselt.be"> Blackboard</a>
  page on the course for more details on this part.
  The teaching assistant will organise a special session for the
  Erasmus students to get familiar with DB2.
  <h2>
    Exam
    </h2>
    Make sure to participate in the written exam!  There will be
    a special exam in English for the Erasmus students, but the
    exam will be held at the same time and place as the ordinary
    students.  <strong>The final score for the course will be a
      combination of the exam results, the spatial data
      assignment score, and the project defense and
      report.</strong>
    <h2> Professor </h2>
    Professor for the course is <a
      href="http://alpha.uhasselt.be/jan.vandenbussche">Jan Van
      den Bussche</a>, and teaching assistant is Tom Ameloot
    (tom.ameloot@uhasselt.be).  Apart from the lecture and the
    DB2 session, there will be no formal classes for the Erasmus
    students.  It is fine to contact professor or assistant for
    questions by email, and an appointment can always be made.
